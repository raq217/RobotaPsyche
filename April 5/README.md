I, Robot 

Isaac Asimov's novel I Robot really touches on how technology can be a spectacle to society but also one that disrupts or destroys it.
Some topics of discussion that I have:

-  The robots are bound by the Three Laws of Robotics:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

2. A robot must obey orders given by a human being unless it conflicts with the First Law.

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection wonâ€™t conflict with the First or Second Law.
Since there are existing laws does this mean a prejudice system for robots is needed? In my opinion, Laws were open for interpretation by the robots and therefore created many contradictory situations.

- In the book, similarily to the movie there is one specific Robot that is able to develop some element of emotions an intellect. If one was able to develop or mutate into such do we think others can or is it a miracle?

- There is reference to telepathic robots and robots who are politcians. Involing robots on politics means that we are inviting them to govern the world we live in but are the Robots living beings? This refers back to my first topic of discussion of sharing our world with a society of Robots.

- What is human? And is humanity obsolete if we have to involve robots so much in our lives? The idea of companionship is explored in the reading as well where the robots are there to primarily be the companions on humanity. I do feel this is basically throwing human responsibilites onto someone/something else instead of trying to solve it on our own. Companionship relates to emotions, feelings and personal intuition which is something robots don't have so how do we expect them to solve it?

- The reading reminded me of the theory of natural selection, what if these robots are truly better than us? If so will we see them as higher than us? How will we be able to avoid such from happening?
