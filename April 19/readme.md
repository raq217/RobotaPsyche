The story Reason by Isaac Asimov is about a time where technology was developed to the point where robots have become very advanced, without much physical work by humans. The plotline is about a robot who can not come to terms with how the world works and does not believe that humans have created him due to this, humans are worried that the robot will no longer be under their control.

The main conflict withiin this story is man vs technology, The robot that was made by man is now no longer under their control, and that is now worrying them. Unlike before, the robot is not accepting what is said or instructed to it and has developed a mind of its own. To me this was quite compliment to Asimov's choice of making the story in third person as it allowed us to see it as someone else. It opens the eyes of the readers through the use of "we, us", a good way that Asimov established a connection.
