Assignment 4:
I found this assignment to be quite challenging as I never used the DNA class before, nor produced an evolution of sorts. My inspiration of this project came from the pandemic game called "Plague Inc" which involves the player trying to save a dying population. This code sort of reflects such but when you press on your mouse you spawn in more vehicles which could be prone to the poision/infection. The more vehicles that exist the harder it is for all of them to survive which is why most of them die out when spawned it.
