Five questions/topics for discussions:

- In the reading, the Five Robots -- A taxomony for Roboethics, the author discusses how ethical considerations of robots could exist through examples such as slavery and animals. I think this is a good point for discussion because robots even if subject to slavery do not have any concept of emotional feeling or damage that pertains to their health. As in they're just like any other device we might overuse. It was a little confusing to have such comparison brought up by the author.

- Another topic of discussion that I found very interesting in the same reading was the notion of how we have become too dependent on robots and AI. The author brings up a specific case where in 2003, power control units show down in 8 states in the US due to autonomous failures. What happens to all the hospitals and clinics that are treating patients? Does this mean that trusting autonomous systems not only reliquishes control of our lives but others as well?

- In the same reading mentioned above the author concludes on the basis of four different gravitational fields:
1) the robot conceived as a mere tool or instrument
2) the robot as a reciepent of ethical behaviour
3) the robot as a moral agent 
4) the robot as a social impact factor
Which gravitation fields do you think have the strongest pull or makes the most sense?

- In the second reading, The Ethical Treatment Of Artificially Conscious Robots the author quotes "the human self changes as a consequence of his or her treatment to androids". Doesn't this mean its more of "you learn from your mistakes?" what happens to those that don't adapt from their first mistake? Generally it takes more than once for a human to recognize or learn what they are doing wrong. 

- One of the conclusions the author brings up in the second reading is that we shouldn't be considering the notion that robots should have ethical rights because animals do. I agree with this because robots do not follow the natural process they are made not created. However despite the differences, the author still says that robots still should have some ethical rights especially in matters of exploitation and acceptable treament, something I agree with.
