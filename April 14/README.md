For my final project I want to write a papr on the ethical responsibility that humans have on Robots especially when we are moving through a wave of autonomy. In class we looked at some works such as I, Robot and discussed the notions of a legal jurisdiction that might have to be established as we integrate AI into our lives. Some questions that I think are very relevant to today are; If a conscious robot becomes malfunctioning and starts to spread a virus to robots and humans similar to COVID-19, would it be ethical according to the robot law to kill the robot spreading the disease? This brings in the second theme of converation that I want to explore which is the growing curiousities of Robots gaining their own self-consious by evolving into something else from what we've built. 
I am currently looking at some sources (this will be updated).
